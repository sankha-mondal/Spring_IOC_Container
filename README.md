# Spring_IOC_Container_DI
Spring IOC Container  ||   Spring provides two types of Containers namely as following:  A) BeanFactory Container   B) ApplicationContext Container

# @Autowire:
Spring framework injects the value for Primitive datatype like int, float, String, double etc.
But if a class contains 'Complex Property' like 'Address' that's why we have to DI explicitly by using 'ref' attribute, it's a part of property
or constractor-arg tags.
@Autowire a freature provided by Spring framework which help to enable us to 'inject the dependancy' of 'Complex Property' implicitly. 
@Autowire is the replacement of 'ref'.
